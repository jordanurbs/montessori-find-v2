## How to Choose the Right Montessori School: A Parent's Guide

April 8, 2025

EducationMontessoriSchool Choice

Choosing a [Montessori school](https://montessorifind.com/schools/explore-montessori) can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here’s what you need to know upfront:

*   **Check Credentials**: Look for schools accredited by AMS ([American Montessori Society](https://amshq.org/)) or AMI ([Association Montessori Internationale](https://montessori-ami.org/)). Only about 1,470 U.S. schools meet these standards.
    
*   **Classroom Features**: Authentic Montessori classrooms have mixed-age groups, uninterrupted 3-hour work periods, and certified teachers using Montessori-specific materials.
    
*   **Teacher Training**: Montessori teachers should have certifications from [MACTE](https://www.macte.org/)\-accredited programs and ongoing professional development.
    
*   **Key Differences**: Montessori focuses on child-led learning, hands-on activities, and developing independence, unlike traditional education’s teacher-driven approach.
    
*   **Red Flags**: Avoid schools with short work periods, heavy reliance on worksheets, or lack of Montessori materials.
    

### Quick Comparison: Montessori vs. Traditional Education




| **Feature** | **Montessori** | **Traditional** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Curriculum Style | Personalized, child-led | Standardized, teacher-driven |
| Classroom Age Groups | Mixed (3-year spans) | Same-age groups |
| Motivation | Internal | Grades and rewards |
| Learning Materials | Hands-on, Montessori-specific | Textbooks, worksheets |
| Focus | Whole-child development | Academic performance |




When visiting schools, ask about teacher certifications, classroom setup, and daily schedules. Use tools like [MontessoriFind](https://montessorifind.com/) to compare schools and read parent reviews. Ultimately, pick a school that aligns with your child’s needs and your family’s values.

## Core Elements of Montessori Education

### What Makes Montessori Different

Montessori stands out by focusing on child-led, hands-on learning, where kids take charge of their education while teachers act as guides in a thoughtfully designed environment.

Did you know that a child’s brain forms **700 new neural connections every second** during early childhood [\[1\]](https://www.whitbyschool.org/passionforlearning/7-key-characteristics-of-a-montessori-preschool)? Montessori uses this critical period to provide tailored learning experiences. Here's how it compares:




| Traditional Education | Montessori Approach |
| --- | --- |
| One-size-fits-all curriculum | Personalized learning paths |
| Teacher-driven lessons | Student-led exploration |
| Same-age classrooms | Mixed-age groups (three-year spans) |
| Heavy focus on academics | Development of the whole child |
| Grades and rewards as motivation | Focus on internal motivation |




Research shows Montessori students often excel in reading and math compared to peers in traditional schools. They also tend to develop stronger social skills and a deeper sense of justice [\[2\]](https://abccdc.com/blog/2021/12/08/differences-between-montessori-and-traditional-preschool/). These differences are essential when evaluating Montessori programs.

### Spotting True Montessori Programs

Out of over 4,000 schools in the U.S. that label themselves as "Montessori", only about 1,470 meet the standards set by major Montessori organizations. Around 1,250 are recognized by the **American Montessori Society (AMS)**, and 220 by the **Association Montessori Internationale (AMI)** [\[3\]](https://hechingerreport.org/will-the-real-montessori-please-stand-up/). So, what defines an authentic program?

**Classroom Environment**

*   Mixed-age groups spanning three years
    
*   Full set of Montessori materials, organized by subject
    
*   Uninterrupted three-hour work periods
    
*   Freedom to move and choose activities
    

**Teaching Approach**

*   Certified Montessori teachers
    
*   Child-led learning with minimal interruptions
    
*   Emphasis on hands-on, practical learning
    
*   Use of natural and logical consequences instead of punishment
    

These classrooms are calm, structured, and designed to encourage both independent and small-group work. Practical life skills are seamlessly integrated with academic lessons, helping children build independence and self-discipline.

## School Credentials and Teacher Training

### School Certification Standards

When evaluating Montessori schools, it's crucial to check if they hold recognized certifications. The two primary accrediting organizations are the **Association Montessori International (AMI)** and the **American Montessori Society (AMS)**. In the U.S., only about 220 schools have AMI recognition[\[6\]](https://sapientiamontessori.com/montessori/ami-accreditation), and roughly 15% of AMS member schools are AMS-accredited[\[5\]](https://amshq.org/About-AMS/Press-kit/AMS-Accredited-School). These certifications reflect some of the highest benchmarks in Montessori education.

AMS accreditation, often regarded as a rigorous standard, follows a demanding seven-year process[\[4\]](https://amshq.org/Educators/Montessori-Schools/AMS-Accreditation). Schools must meet high expectations in several areas, such as:




| Area of Assessment | Key Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Educational Program | Use of Montessori materials and teaching methods |
| Health and Safety | Strong safety protocols and appropriate facilities |
| Administrative Systems | Reliable financial and operational management |




Schools with strong institutional certifications often maintain high standards in teacher training as well.

### Required Teacher Qualifications

Montessori education places a strong emphasis on qualified teachers. Certified Montessori teachers usually have:

*   A bachelor's degree from an accredited university
    
*   Montessori certification specific to the age group they teach
    
*   Training from a program certified by MACTE (Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education)
    
*   Ongoing professional development to refine their skills
    

> "To aid life ... that is the basic task of the educator." - Maria Montessori[\[8\]](https://montessori-ami.org/about-montessori/montessori-educators)

Becoming a certified Montessori teacher typically takes one to two years. This includes in-depth coursework and a year-long hands-on practicum[\[7\]](https://amshq.org/Educators/Montessori-Careers/Become-a-Montessori-Educator). Teachers may hold either AMI or AMS certifications, each offering a slightly different perspective on Montessori methods:




| AMI-Trained Teachers | AMS-Trained Teachers |
| --- | --- |
| Focus on traditional Montessori principles | Combine traditional methods with modern resources |
| Use classic Montessori materials | Blend Montessori materials with additional tools |
| Follow the original curriculum closely | Adapt the curriculum while keeping core principles intact |




When visiting a school, ask about the qualifications of lead teachers and their participation in ongoing training. Confirm that teachers hold Montessori certifications for the age groups they teach and are actively engaged in professional development[\[9\]](https://www.greenchildmagazine.com/finding-authentic-montessori-school/). Since the term "Montessori" is not trademarked, verifying credentials is key to ensuring the school offers an authentic Montessori experience[\[9\]](https://www.greenchildmagazine.com/finding-authentic-montessori-school/).

## What to Look for in Classrooms

### Standard Classroom Elements

When evaluating a Montessori classroom, the physical environment plays a big role in determining its authenticity. A true Montessori space should feel warm, bright, and welcoming. As you visit schools, keep an eye out for these key features:




| Element | What to Look For |
| --- | --- |
| **Physical Layout** | Open floor plan with child-sized furniture and easily accessible low shelves |
| **Learning Areas** | Clearly defined spaces for different subjects (Practical Life, Sensorial, Mathematics, Language, and Cultural Studies) |
| **Natural Elements** | Plenty of natural light, plants, and materials like wood |
| **Practical Life** | Real-life tools designed for children and activities that build everyday skills |
| **Learning Materials** | Montessori-specific materials arranged from simple to more advanced concepts |




Another important aspect is the presence of multi-age groupings, such as children aged 3–6 learning together. This structure encourages peer-to-peer learning and collaboration.

> "The first aim of the prepared environment is, as far as it is possible, to render the growing child independent of the adult." - Maria Montessori [\[10\]](https://academyofthewinds.org/blog/6-components-of-a-montessori-classroom)

### Classroom Quality Indicators

To determine whether a classroom truly follows Montessori principles, focus on these indicators:

*   **Student Independence**  
    Children should be able to work on their own, with materials stored on low, accessible shelves.
    
*   **Material Quality and Organization**  
    Look for authentic Montessori materials made from durable materials like wood and metal. These should be arranged in a logical sequence to guide learning.
    
*   **Active Learning Environment**  
    Observe whether children are engaged in hands-on activities, working with focus, collaborating across age groups, and helping maintain the classroom.
    

A well-prepared Montessori classroom is thoughtfully organized by subject area, promoting curiosity and self-guided learning. Here’s a breakdown of curriculum areas and some essential materials:




| Curriculum Area | Key Materials |
| --- | --- |
| **Practical Life** | Polishing tools, pouring sets, dressing frames |
| **Sensorial** | Pink tower, brown stairs, cylinder blocks |
| **Mathematics** | Number rods, golden beads, counting frames |
| **Language** | Sandpaper letters, moveable alphabet, small objects for phonetic practice |
| **Cultural Studies** | Puzzle maps, timelines, science materials |




The atmosphere should feel calm and orderly, allowing children to move and converse naturally. Teachers act as guides, stepping in only when needed, rather than directing every activity.

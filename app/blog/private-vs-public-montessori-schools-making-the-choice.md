## Private vs Public Montessori Schools: Making the Choice

March 10, 2025

EducationMontessoriSchool Choice

Choosing between private and public Montessori schools depends on factors like budget, curriculum, and accessibility. Here's a quick breakdown:

*   **Private Montessori Schools**: Typically follow Montessori principles more closely, charge tuition ($12,000–$18,000/year), and offer flexible programs with full Montessori materials.
    
*   **Public Montessori Schools**: Tuition-free but must align with state education standards. They may have fewer resources and rely on lotteries for enrollment.
    

### Quick Comparison




| Feature | Private Montessori | Public Montessori |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | $12,000–$18,000/year | Free (minimal fees) |
| **Curriculum** | Strict Montessori approach | Mix of Montessori and state standards |
| **Enrollment** | Application, interview | Open enrollment, lottery |
| **Teacher Requirements** | Montessori certification | State license + Montessori certification |
| **Class Size** | 28–35 students | 20–30 students |
| **Extra Costs** | High (e.g., materials, aftercare) | Low to moderate (e.g., supplies, transportation) |




Consider your budget, location, and child’s needs to make the best choice. Keep reading for a deeper dive into the differences, costs, and what to look for during school visits.

## Main Differences: Private vs Public Montessori

### Money and Enrollment

The funding structure is a key difference between private and public Montessori schools, influencing both operations and accessibility.

Private Montessori schools rely on tuition fees, donations, and fundraising. This funding model allows for greater independence but comes with higher costs. In contrast, public Montessori schools are government-funded and provide tuition-free education. For example, [Carson Montessori Charter School](https://www.carsonmontessori.com/) offers free education and accepts students from any county, requiring only basic documents like birth certificates and immunization records.

The enrollment process also differs:




| Aspect | Private Montessori | Public Montessori |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | Tuition-based | Free |
| Admission Process | School tour, interview, and readiness assessment | Open enrollment, lottery system |
| Priority System | School-specific criteria | Siblings and children of faculty prioritized |
| Special Needs | May require additional documentation | Must comply with federal and non-discrimination policies |




Now, let’s explore how teaching methods vary between these schools.

### Teaching Methods

Private Montessori schools typically adhere more closely to traditional Montessori principles. They offer flexibility with uninterrupted work periods, personalized learning paths, and less focus on standardized testing.

Public Montessori schools, however, must align Montessori practices with state education requirements. This means incorporating standardized testing and state-mandated curricula while still preserving key Montessori elements.

### Staff Requirements

Teacher qualifications also set these schools apart.

In public Montessori schools, teachers are required to hold state teaching licenses in addition to Montessori certification. This ensures they can integrate state education standards with Montessori methods.

Private Montessori schools, on the other hand, have more leeway in their hiring practices. They prioritize Montessori-specific training and experience but don’t necessarily require state teaching licenses. Both types of schools emphasize professional growth, with public school teachers maintaining both state licenses and Montessori credentials.

## Cost Breakdown

### School Fees

Public Montessori schools are generally free of tuition, aside from small activity fees. Private Montessori schools, however, can be expensive. For example, [Raintree Montessori School](https://raintreemontessori.org/current/)'s tuition rates for 2024-25 give a clear picture of typical private school costs [\[3\]](https://raintreemontessori.org/current/tuition):




| Program Level | Annual Tuition |
| --- | --- |
| Toddler (All-day) | $16,104 |
| Primary (All-day) | $13,704 |
| Primary (Half-day) | $9,708 |
| Elementary | $11,090 |
| Erdkinder | $13,360 |




After understanding tuition, it’s important to explore financial aid options.

### Payment Help Options

Private Montessori schools often provide financial assistance through these methods:

*   **529 Savings Accounts**: Since 2018, these accounts can be used for K-12 education, allowing families to allocate up to $10,000 annually toward private school tuition [\[2\]](https://amshq.org/Families/Financial-Aid).
    
*   **School-Based Aid**: Some schools, like [Catskill Montessori](https://catskillmontessori.org/) in New York, offer sliding scale tuition based on family income [\[5\]](https://notjustschools.com/financial-aid-in-montessori-schools/).
    
*   **State Programs**: In some states, families can access vouchers, tax credits, or education savings accounts to help cover private school costs [\[2\]](https://amshq.org/Families/Financial-Aid).
    

> "Don't be afraid to ask about a school's financial aid opportunities. It is one of the most common questions parents ask of private-school administrators." - The American Montessori Society [\[2\]](https://amshq.org/Families/Financial-Aid)

Once tuition and aid are considered, it’s essential to account for additional expenses.

### Extra Expenses

Both public and private Montessori schools come with extra costs. Here's a look at some common annual expenses:




| Expense Category | Private Montessori | Public Montessori |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration Fee | $100 - $400 | $0 - $50 |
| Materials Fee | $250 - $1,200 | $0 - $600 |
| Before/After Care | $3,800 - $7,300 | $0 - $7,200 |
| Transportation | $700 - $2,700 | Often included |
| Lunch Program | $500 - $1,000 | $0 - $300 |




For public Montessori schools, additional yearly costs typically range from $650 to $1,500 per student [\[1\]](https://trustedcare.com/costs/montessori-schools-cost). Private schools may charge for extras such as:

*   Spring break camps ($200 - $600 per week)
    
*   Summer programs ($2,000 - $6,000 per summer)
    
*   Application processing fees ($25 - $100)
    
*   Late payment fees
    

These extra costs can add up, making it crucial to plan ahead when budgeting for Montessori education.

## School Facilities and Materials

### Learning Materials

The quality and availability of Montessori learning materials can vary significantly. Private Montessori schools often provide a full set of materials for each classroom, while public Montessori programs may need to share resources due to tighter budgets [\[7\]](https://amshq.org/blog/montessori-education/2022-06-09-montessori-with-integrity-part-1-considering-the-quality-of-program-implementation/).




| Aspect | Private Montessori | Public Montessori |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Materials | Full sets available for every classroom | Often shared between classrooms |
| Student Access | Typically provided individually | Frequently shared among students |




These differences in materials affect more than just access - they also impact classroom dynamics, including class size and staffing.

### Class Size

Montessori classrooms are typically larger and include students of different ages, fostering a collaborative learning environment. The American Montessori Society (AMS) highlights this approach:

> "Montessori values larger, multi-age classes that foster peer-supported learning" [\[6\]](https://washingtonmontessori.org/stories/why-montessori-schools-have-larger-class-sizes/)

Here’s a comparison of typical class setups:




| School Type | Student Count | Staff Composition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private Montessori | 28–35 students | 1 lead teacher + 1 assistant |
| Public Montessori | 20–30 students | 1 lead teacher + 1 assistant |




For example, [Washington Montessori School](https://washingtonmontessori.org/) organizes classrooms with 20–28 students, supported by a head teacher and an associate teacher, adhering to these principles [\[6\]](https://washingtonmontessori.org/stories/why-montessori-schools-have-larger-class-sizes/).

### Additional Programs

Private Montessori schools often have the advantage of flexible funding, allowing them to offer a wider range of enrichment programs. These may include arts, music, outdoor education, and foreign languages. Public Montessori programs, on the other hand, may face limitations in offering such activities due to budget constraints [\[4\]](https://www.genevamontessori.org/public-school-vs-private-school).

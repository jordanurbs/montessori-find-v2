# About Page Image Requirements

To properly display the About page, the following images need to be added to the `/public/assets/` directory:

1. `/public/assets/montessori-classroom.jpg` - A high-quality image of a Montessori classroom showing materials and learning environment.
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px
   - This image appears in the top banner area of the About page

2. `/public/assets/jordan-with-kids.jpg` - An image of Jordan with his children.
   - Recommended size: 600x600px
   - This image appears in the "About the Creator" section

Please ensure both images are properly optimized for web (compressed without significant quality loss) and represent the Montessori educational environment effectively.

## Image Placeholder Usage

Until the actual images are provided, you can use placeholder services or create your own placeholder images. In production, replace these with actual high-quality images that match the brand identity.
